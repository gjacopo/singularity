 [**Numerical methods for the estimation of singularity spectra on sampled data: a comparative study**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999105005565),

You need to create your own hierarchy of directories, as follows:

          EXP -------- benchmark ------ A
                 |                 |--- B
                 |                 |--- C   
                 |          
                 |---- wtmm ----------- A     
                 |                 |--- B
                 |                 |--- C        
                 |          
                 |---- lastwave ------- A
                 |                 |--- B
                 |                 |--- C
                 |          
                 |---- wavelab -------- A
                 |                 |--- B
                 |                 |--- C
                 |                 |--- wavelib
                 |                 |--- test
                 |          
                 |---- fraclab -------- A
                                   |--- B
                                   |--- C
                                   |--- fraclib
                                   |--- test
 
Note that the name of the main directory (_EXP_ in the example above) 
doesn't matter whereas the others do.

## benchmark

The directory `benchmark/` will contain all the data used in the various
experiments. 

In this directory, there is a script:

	buildbench.sh 
that enables to generate all the multifractal signals and to install 
them in the corresponding sub-directories `A/`, `B/` and `C/` once 
`multifractal_generator` has been copied in `bin/`.
(note : in this file, change the name `multifractal_generator.exe`
into `multifractal_generator`).

## wtmm

The directory `wtmm/` will contain all the results of the WTMM analysis 
with our code.

In this directory, there is a script:

	procwtmm.sh
that enables to compute the singularity spectra of the signals in 
benchmark and to install the results of these estimations in the 
corresponding sub-directories `A/`, `B/` and `C/` once `wtmm_processor` has 
been copied in `bin/`.
(note : in `procwtmm.sh`, 
   i/ first change the name `wtmm_processor.exe` into `wtmm_processor`, 
   ii/ then read carefully the first lines of comments to have info about the processing, 
  iii/ the program needs approx. 20 mn to run with our data)

## lastwave

The directory `lastwave/` stores the main program for analyzing the 
signals with the WTMM method implemented in the _LastWave_ software.

In this directory, the file `analysisLastWTMM1d.def` contains the 
routines to process the analysis. To use the functions defined in 
this file, launch the software _LastWave_ and type:

 	a> source analysisLastWTMM1d.def
("a>" is the prompt of lastwave). With the command:

	a> help AnalyzeSeriesLastWTMM 
you will have some information about the main function used to 
analyze our data.

If you want to analyze for instance the 10 signals Log-Poisson of 
size 4096 and with parameters `h_infty=-0.5` and `D_\infty=0`, type the 
command:

	a> AnalyzeSeriesLastWTMM '../benchmark/B' 'B' 'Log-Poisson.h-0.50-coD1.00_1D' \
		10 1.5 8. 10. 'g2' {-200} -200 -200 
See the help of function `AnalyzeSeriesLastWTMM` and the code for a 
complete description.

## wavelab

The directory `wavelab/` contains the main program for analyzing the
signals with the WTMM method implemented in the _WaveLab802_ software.

  1. either you install the library _WaveLab_ in your environment; then, 
  you  add the path of the directory _WaveLab_ to the `PATH` variable of 
  _Matlab_, _e.g._ thanks to the command addpath (See the help of function 
  `procWaveWTMM1d`, below).
  2. you use the 'stand-alone' files provided in the sub-directory
  `wavelib/` of the directory `wavelab/`. They are copies of the _Wavelab_  
  necessary files. 

In _Matlab_, move to the directory `wavelab/`. Then, in order to perform 
the estimation for all the series, you should type:

	> procWaveWTMM1d('all','all');
(">" is the prompt of Matlab). The processing of all the series takes 
about 15mn. 
However, you may want to try first over small dataset to begin, so 
type for example:

	> procWaveWTMM1d('A',1);
to perform the analysis only for the multifractal serie stored in file 
`Log-Poisson.h-0.50-coD1.00_1D-N000.txt` of set `A`. For more details, get 
the help of function `procWaveWTMM1d` by typing:

	> help procWaveWTMM1d
The function performing the main computation is stored in the file 
`myAnalyzeSeriesWaveWTMM`; type

	> help myAnalyzeSeriesWaveWTMM
for help and have a look on the code inside this file.
Note that this method uses only the classical method to compute the 
Legendre transform (not the canonical one, like in _Lastwave_).

You can have a look in the test file, whose purpose is to use different 
implementations (but all using the main _WaveLab_ functions) for 
retrieving similar results.

## fraclab

The directory `fraclab/` contains the main program for analyzing the 
signals with the WTMM method implemented in the _FracLab_ software.

First of all, you should be sure that the fraclab functions are known 
in the _Matlab_ environment. For this purpose, you have two solutions:

  1. either you install the library _FracLab_ in your environment; then, 
  you need to add the path of the directory _FracLab_ to the `PATH` variable 
  of _Matlab_, _e.g._ thanks to the command addpath (See the help of function 
  `procFracWTMM1d`, below).
  2. you use the 'stand-alone' files provided in the sub-directory 
  `fraclib/` of the directory `fraclab/`. 

In _Matlab_, move to the directory `fraclab/`. Then, in order to perform 
the estimation for all the series, you should type: 

	> procFracWTMM1d('all','all');
The processing of all the series takes about 25mn.  
However, you may want to try first over small dataset to begin, so type 
for example:

	> procFracWTMM1d('A',1); 
to perform the analysis only for the multifractal stored in file  
`Log-Poisson.h-0.50-coD1.00_1D-N000.txt` of set A. For more details, get 
the help of function `procFracWTMM1d` by typing:

	> help procFracWTMM1d
The function performing the main computation is stored in the file 
`myAnalyzeSeriesFracWTMM`; type

	> help myAnalyzeSeriesFracWTMM
for help and have a look on the code.
Note that this method uses only the classical method to compute the 
Legendre transform.

We however recommand first to have a look on the `README` of the 
sub-directory `test/` and to perform the operations described therein. 
The aim of the described operations is to help you to understand how
_FracLab_ works, to see the results it provides and eventually see some 
of its limitations (not the canonical one, like in lastwave).
